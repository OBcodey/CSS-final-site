            <h2>The History of Rotterdam</h2>
            <p>  Rotterdam, a city in the Netherlands, began as a small fishing village in the 13th century, taking its name from a dam built on the Rotte River. It gained city rights in 1340 and gradually grew into an important trading and port city, especially during the Dutch Golden Age. A pivotal moment in its history occurred during World War II, when much of the city center was destroyed in a German bombing raid in 1940. This devastation led to a bold and modern reconstruction, distinguishing Rotterdam with innovative architecture and urban design. In the post-war era, it became home to the largest port in Europe, reinforcing its role as a key hub in global trade. Today, Rotterdam is known for its modern skyline, cultural diversity, and pioneering spirit.   </p>
